# Substitute Teaching (suppléance):  
 
 - In the case of absence or illness, a teacher can contact a GWD colleague to  replace  him or her (and inform the chairperson) or contact the chairperson to find a substitute. The substitute teacher will be paid à La Leçon.
 - For absences other than illness, replacement teachers will only be paid if a prior  arrangement  with HR has been authorized.
 - For absences over ten working days, the replacement job will accord a priority to  teachers that are not fulltime. If the part-time teachers cannot substitute, then it will be posted on the JAC Career website. Teachers with less than a full-time contract  have hiring priority for posted jobs.
