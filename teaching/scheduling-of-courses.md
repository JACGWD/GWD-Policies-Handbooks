# Scheduling of Courses:

Consideration should be given to several factors:

- A half hour break is compulsory between 11:00 and 14:00
- The requested hours must give a full-time teacher a 4-day schedule;
- Before seniority considerations, we must adhere to the College’s request that for  teachers who are studying in the Performa courses, be given their Fridays off;
- To also keep in mind that GWD teachers are asked to give approximately 3 hours per week of office hours;
- The total availability that a teacher gives to the College is a 32-1/2 hours per week;
- The common meeting times for GWD faculty are on Friday afternoons as we make these available for meetings and also for technicians to repair/update/change/    improve our labs.
- For the Fall semester, the schedules are built during the preceding March break. For the winter semester, the schedules are built around the Thanksgiving weekend. 

 After compiling the different requests from all teachers (either by email or face-to-face), the chair will ask all teachers their preference:

- Monday through Thursday preference or Tuesday through Friday preference
- All mornings or all afternoons or a mix of mornings and afternoons
- Which labs are preferable for which courses.
