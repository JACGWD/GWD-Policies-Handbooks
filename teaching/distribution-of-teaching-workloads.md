# GWD Distribution of Teaching Workloads:
 
 Course allocation is determined by:
 - Looking at seniority by entry date in the GWD Day Division at John Abbott College;
 - Technical expertise; 
 - Course preference;
 - Tenured teachers must be given a full-time workload before non-tenured teachers;
 - All full-time teachers in GWD teach two courses with two sections of 4 hours each, for a grand total of 16 hours per week. (Stage is an exception as it has 8 hours,  therefore the teacher has 1 course with two sections).

See the [GWD Departmental Seniority List](../department/departmental-seniority-list.md)
