# Availability: What hours am I available to the College - what are my working hours?

This is a tricky one. Technically, we are paid to work 32.5 hours a week. However, per the Collective Agreement, the College owns us, we can be required to work on any work day(?) as long as there are 14 hours elapsed between the end of that required presence and our next required availability period (usually a class or meeting). Since we normally only schedule our classes from 8:30am, you can be required to attend a meeting, etc, until 6:30pm if you teach at 8:30am the next day.

## Part time

## Holidays
Over the summer break, we are not available to the College. In theory, any work we do during the non-availability period (approximately 8 weeks) must be paid. The last day of availability is around June 15, and the first day of availability is around August 15.
