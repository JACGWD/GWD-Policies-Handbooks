# How does parking work?

Painfully, ha ha. There are teacher parking passes for sale in the summer. Check Omnivox regularly. There are passes for one semester or for the whole year. With that parking pass you may park in employee parking (but not McGill employee parking) and student parking areas. You may choose to pay the parking pass in one shot or have it taken from your pay in installments.

Parking can be scarce, especially in the winter months when snowbanks take away some spots. Arriving before 8am guarantees easy parking. Otherwise, try to arrive at times when students are leaving campus after classes such as between 10:15 and 10:45am, between 12:15 and 12:45pm or between 2:15 and 2:45pm. 

There are several charging stations for electric vehicles on campus.
