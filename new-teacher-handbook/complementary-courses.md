# GWD Complementary Courses

We do not have complementary GWD courses anymore. Since the French requirements changed, most departments no longer have complementaries unless they are taught in French and even then, hours have been radically cut. 

GWD (day) always had intersession, a complementary photoshop class, and night classes - usually photoshop, illustrator, and web 1. Now we have none.
