# When and how do I get evaluated?

New teachers are evaluated by students every semester for the first few (can't remember the number, something between 3 and 6) semesters, then every 5 years after that. The results of your first evaluation you choose an experienced teacher peer to review with you. The ones after that you review with the Dean.
