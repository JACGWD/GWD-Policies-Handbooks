# Who gets available contracts first?

These are given in order by seniority.

The seniority list comes out every November and the priority stipulated on that list is used to determine the priority in awarding contracts for the following two semesters (the Winter one and the following Fall one). 

Teachers hired after the seniority list comes out are awarded contracts by hiring order. If more than one teacher is hired at the same time, the order given to the new hires is respected for contract awarding. A teacher might have Cont Ed experience which would give them higher seniority in the future.
