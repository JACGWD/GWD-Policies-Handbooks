# What is CI?

CI is the mathematical formula used to calculate your workload.

## What counts towards CI?

The CI factors in the number of courses taught, the number of different course preparations per semester and the number of students in each class (as of the drop date). There are additional calculations for teachers supervising student fieldwork (stages), with release time, or who have to travel between teaching areas. The complete formula appears in Annex I-1 of the collective agreement.


There is a [CI calculator on the JACFA web page](https://www.jacfa.ca/information-for-faculty/workload-ci-calculator/).
