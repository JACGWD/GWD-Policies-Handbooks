# What is a POSTE?

The College and Union, in anticipation of every new semester, figure out how many sections of every course will be taught. From that (plus chair release amounts), they determine how many theoretical full-time teachers will be needed for each department. Each theoretical full-time teacher = 1 POST. 

In practice, we end up with more teachers because the number of preps per teacher, releases, leaves all end up generating more teacher loads. As of 2025-2026, our department has 7 postes, occupied by: Jan, Rick, Eric, Kellie-Rae, Belinda, Corinne, and Ian. With the turnover from 412 to 570, another poste will likely open up soon.
