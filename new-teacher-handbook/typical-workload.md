# What does a typical workload in our department look like?

Usually, most teachers teach 16 hours of classes, usually in sections of 2 courses. Since tenured or full-year contract teachers have committed to a full year, there may be an imbalance between semesters since the allocation will be compensated in the other semester. This is known asa *front loading* or *back loading*.

Workloads are actually calculated as CI (see [other question](./what-is-ci.md)).

The teacher workload also includes office hours (see [other question](#)), course prep and corrections. In addition, every teacher is expected to provide 173 hours of professional services (see [extra hours](./extra-hours.md)).
