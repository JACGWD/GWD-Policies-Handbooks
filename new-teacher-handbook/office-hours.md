# Office Hours

Office hours are, essentially, up to you. That said, if you do not specify what days you are available, HR "assumes" your availability is averaged across the week so if they schedule something you do not attend, they can discipline you. Again, this is highly contentious and there are currently over 50 grievances filed because of it. 

The simplest approach is to call in sick if there is a "mandatory event". It is also very much worthwhile to only be available on campus 4 days a week and keep online office hours, ie, by written appointment. Personally, I do not give office hours to students, I tell them to arrange a meeting outside class time  via MIO.

Your working hours is more complex. 

Effectively, as a day teacher, you are getting paid 37.5 hours. You have volet 1 duties (teaching, marking) but also volet 2 duties (office hours, helping students, meetings, related secondary teaching duties). 

This is where things get interesting. The union maintains that if you make yourself available on a WFH basis this is the same as being on campus. The administration is trying to claim that you need to spend a specific number of hours physically on campus. If you cancel classes but call it a half day because you are available on a WFH basis and HR tried to use a full sick day instead of a half day on your pay, you can take it up with the union. Similarly if admin tries to insist that you "must" come to an optional meeting like the welcome back breakfast, you can refuse and if they try to dock your pay, you can go to the union.
