# Will I get paid in the summer?

If you have a full-year contract, you will be paid over the non-availability period (10 weeks over the summer). A full- year contract is obtained if you are hired into a POST (see other question), or are replacing someone on a full-year leave.  If you end up with a full-time contract in the Fall and then another full-time contract in the Winter, for a total at or near 80 for the year (see [CI question](./what-is-ci.md)) your two contracts will be converted into a full year contract and you will be paid over the summer.

If you do not end up with a full-year contract, you will receive pro-rated vacation pay at the end of your contract.
