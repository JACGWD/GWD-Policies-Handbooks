# How much flexibility do I have as a teacher? 

As a teacher, you are hired to deliver a course that will ensure that students meet the objectives defined by the ministry of education. You are considered a subject matter professional and are given discretion as to which means you consider the most pedagogically appropriate to attain those objectives. In other words, you call the shots in your classroom.

However, you also want to make sure that your course harmonizes well with the techniques taught in other courses, and integrates well with the flow of the global project. Team work is a key element in 570, as we need to minimize attrition. Uncoordinated courses tend to add to student workload, and excessive workload is one of the main factors for students dropping the program.

## Can I change the course outline? 

As long as you respect the course outline framework that was approved by CVC (Curriculum Validation Committee), you can customize the course outline as you deem necessary.

## Can I teach things in a different order? 

Apart from coordinating deliverables for the global project, you are free to establish the calendar for your course.

## Can I change course content or change technology?

Major changes should be presented to the department for approval before being adopted in the classroom.
