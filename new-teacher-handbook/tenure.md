# How does tenure work? 

The Collective agreement has the details, from our understanding, the most typical path is that after 3 full year contracts, if your next contract (starting your 4th year) is in a POSTE (see [other question here](./what-is-a-poste.md)), then you are tenured. 

There is another path with a certain number of part-time loads, please consult the collective agreement.
