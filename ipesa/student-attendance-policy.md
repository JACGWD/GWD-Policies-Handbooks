## History

### Prior to Winter 2026

 Attendance is compulsory in GWD. Excessive absences are grounds for failure—the instructor reserves the right to discontinue evaluation of a student’s work if s/he has more than four (4) classes or 13.3% of unexcused absences. Students are expected to attend all classes and complete all assigned work. If class work is not completed and handed in, the student will be considered absent for that class. It is the responsibility of the student to identify and make up missed course work.
 Students missing classes due to religious observances must inform their teachers the first week of the semester in writing. Both student and teacher are responsible for making alternate arrangements should any evaluations conflict with such dates.
