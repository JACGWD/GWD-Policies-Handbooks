Students are responsible for backing up their digital files appropriately in order to respect the course schedule as outlined here.

A late penalty of between 5 to 10% per calendar day might apply to assignments submitted late up to a maximum number of allowed late days.

The exact percentage and the maximum will be indicated on the instructions specific to that assignment. Any work submitted after the maximum number of allowed late days has been reached will not be graded.
